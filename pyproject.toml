description = "This extension adds CUDA device selection to supported loader nodes in ComfyUI. By monkey-patching ComfyUIâ€™s memory management, each model component (like UNet, Clip, or VAE) can be loaded on a specific GPU. Examples included are multi-GPU workflows for SDXL, FLUX, LTXVideo, and Hunyuan Video for both standard and GGUF loader nodes."
